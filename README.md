# Speech-emotion-recognition

This repository contains code for a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system, designed to analyze and classify emotions from speech signals. It utilizes machine learning techniques to process audio inputs and predict the associated emotional state.

Features
Preprocessing of audio signals for noise reduction and feature extraction.
Extraction of key audio features such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).
Implementation of machine learning models to classify emotions.
Evaluation and visualization of model performance.
Dataset
The project may rely on publicly available datasets for emotion recognition, such as:

RAVDESS: Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song.
TESS: Toronto Emotional Speech Set.
CREMA-D: Crowd-sourced Emotional Multimodal Actors Dataset.
Ensure the dataset is downloaded and correctly structured before running the code.

Usage
Install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt  
Load and preprocess the dataset by running the notebook step-by-step.

Train the machine learning model to classify speech emotions.

Evaluate the model's accuracy and visualize the results.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Librosa: For audio processing and feature extraction.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning models and evaluation.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For result visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and analysis.
Applications
Call center emotion analysis.
Human-computer interaction systems.
Mental health monitoring.
