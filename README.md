# Speech-emotion-recognition


This repository showcases a machine learning project designed to classify emotions from speech by analyzing vocal characteristics such as pitch, tone, frequency, and modulation. The goal is to identify emotional states and categorize them into distinct emotional tones using advanced feature extraction and statistical analysis techniques.

Features
Emotion Classification: Detect and classify speech into eight distinct emotional tones.
Vocal Feature Analysis: Leverage key vocal characteristics such as pitch, tone, frequency, and modulation.
Statistical Analysis: Conduct in-depth statistical evaluations to enhance the accuracy of emotion detection.
Emotional Classification Graphs: Visualize emotional tones derived from speech patterns.
Key Methodologies
Feature Extraction:

Extract vital audio features, including MFCCs, chroma, and spectral contrast, to encapsulate speech patterns.
Machine Learning Algorithms:

Train and evaluate machine learning models tailored for emotion classification.
Statistical Analysis:

Perform detailed statistical computations to improve the reliability of emotion predictions.
Visualization:

Generate emotional classification graphs for intuitive interpretation of results.
Technologies Used
Python: Core language for development.
Librosa: For audio signal processing and feature extraction.
Pandas: For handling and analyzing structured data.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For creating emotional classification graphs.
Applications
Emotion-based enhancements in virtual assistants.
Emotional analytics for customer support systems.
Tools for mental health monitoring through speech analysis.
